## 1. Arithmetic Series

**Description**:  
Computes the sum of an arithmetic sequence of numbers.

**Skills**:  
- Recursive functions
- Basic integer operations

---

## 2. Count Elements

**Description**:  
Counts the number of occurrences of each element in a list and returns a summary.

**Skills**:  
- Working with lists
- Using association lists (key-value pairs)

---

## 3. Merge Sorted Lists of Pairs

**Description**:  
Merges two sorted lists of pairs (`(key, value)`) into one sorted list based on their keys.

**Skills**:  
- Pattern matching
- List recursion
- Merging algorithms

---

## 4. Find Word in the Text

**Description**:  
Searches for the occurrence of a given word inside a text string.

**Skills**:  
- String manipulation
- Sliding window algorithms

---

## 5. Currency Converter

**Description**:  
A simple OCaml program that converts between major currencies using predefined exchange rates.

**Skills**:  
- Mapping between currencies
- Floating-point calculations
- Input validation

---

## 6. Shift Array Right

**Description**:  
Creates a list from 1 to `n` and rotates (shifts) it to the right by `k` positions.

**Skills**:  
- List creation
- List splitting and concatenation
- Modular arithmetic

---

## 7. Prime Number Scanner

**Description**:  
Prints the first `n` prime numbers.

**Skills**:  
- Number theory (prime checking)
- Recursive helper functions
- Working with references (`ref`) for state tracking

---

## 8. Simple Library System

**Description**:  
Manages a collection of books, providing functions to filter available books and group them by genre.

**Skills**:  
- Defining custom types (`record type`)
- List filtering and grouping
- Functional data transformation

---

## 9. Replace Submatrix

**Description**:  
Replaces a submatrix inside a given matrix with another smaller matrix, starting from a specified position.

**Skills**:  
- Array manipulation
- Deep copying of arrays
- Handling edge cases when matrices differ in size
