Algorithmic problems in the Ocaml programming language.
This project includes solutions to four classic problems implemented in the OCaml programming language. They cover basic skills in working with lists, pairs, and strings:

1. Arithmetic Series — computing the sum of an arithmetic sequence.

2. Count Elements — counting the number of occurrences of each element in a list.

3. Merge Sorted Lists of Pairs — merging two sorted lists of pairs based on their keys.

4. Find Word in the Text — searching for a given word in a text string.

5. Currency converter — OCaml program that converts between major currencies using predefined exchange rates.
